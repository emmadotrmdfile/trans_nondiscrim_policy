README

Repository for my first ever project at the Institute of Public Policy and Social Research (IPPSR). Features a state-year panel dataset from 2000-2024 that analyzes transgender non-discrimination policy and religious exemption laws. Also includes the .rmd file used to create the maps, the maps in .pdf format, and my codebook for the project.
